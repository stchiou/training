			<h2>Terminology in PLS</h2>
					<h3 id="assignment">Assignment Profile/Job Code</h3>
					<p>Assignment Profile and Job Code are the terms that are used interchangeably
					to refer to a collection of curricula that would be assigned to a learner
					in PLS. In general, an Assignment Profile is created to loosely align
					with the function or role that the learner would need to perform after
					finishing the curricula covered by the Assignment Profile. An individual
					will have more than one Assignment Profiles in his/her PLS account.
					An Assignment Profile can be referred by its name (description) or code.</p>
					<h3 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h3>
					<p>Curriculum is a collection of executable learning activities, such as
					Course, Structured On the Job Training (OJT), Standard Operating Procedure
					(SOP, GMP Controlled Documents, Policies, etc) that assign to individual
					learner through Assignment Profile. A good proportion of the curricula
					and the Assignment Profile in the CQ Lab share the same name and code.</p>
					<h3 id="item">Items</h3>
					<p>Items are individual executable learning activities that have been
					grouped into curriculum. Individual items has been assigned with due
					date which is the date that the item needs to be completed. Failure of
					completion in a timely manner results in the suspension of the badge.
					The items in PLS has a descriptive name as well as item code.</p>
